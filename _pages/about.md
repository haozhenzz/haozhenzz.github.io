I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the University of Georgia, under the mentorship of Prof. [Jidong Yang](https://engineering.uga.edu/team_member/jidong-yang/) in the Smart Mobility and Infrastructure Lab. I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Renewable Energy Science and Engineering and a Master of Management degree from North China Electric Power University. I am currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Civil and Environmental Engineering. My research mainly focuses on intelligent transportation, transport safety, equity, and transportation planning, to locate and tackle new problems and push the boundaries of challenges with new techniques.
